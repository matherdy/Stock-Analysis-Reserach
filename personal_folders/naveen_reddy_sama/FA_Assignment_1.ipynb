        "On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a technical analysis indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price. OBV takes into account the cumulative volume of an asset over a period of time and assigns positive or negative values to the volume depending on whether the price of the asset closes higher or lower than the previous day's closing price. OBV can be used to confirm trends and to identify potential price reversals. When the price and OBV move in opposite directions, it can signal a divergence and potentially indicate a reversal. OBV is a popular tool used by traders to gain insight into the buying and selling pressure behind a security's price movements."
